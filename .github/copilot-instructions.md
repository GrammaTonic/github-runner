# GitHub Runner - AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

This repository is for setting up and managing GitHub Actions self-hosted runners using Docker containers for a single repository. The project focuses on automating containerized runner deployment, configuration, and lifecycle management with Docker and Docker Compose.

## RULES AND STANDARDS
- USE Non interactive gh CLI commands for all GitHub operations
- ALWAYS follow the established development workflow and branch protection rules
- NEVER create .md files in the root directory; all documentation must go in `/docs/` subdirectories
- ALWAYS use the provided scripts for setup, deployment, and validation tasks

## 🚨 CRITICAL WORKFLOW & BRANCH PROTECTION RULES

### Branch Protection Status - ENFORCED

- **`main` branch**: PROTECTED with branch protection rules
- **`develop` branch**: PROTECTED with branch protection rules
- **Direct pushes BLOCKED**: All changes must go through pull requests
- **Review required**: 1 approving review required before merge
- **Status checks required**: CI/CD Pipeline must pass before merge
- **Force pushes BLOCKED**: History integrity preserved
- **Conversation resolution**: All PR comments must be resolved

### Development Workflow - MANDATORY

1. **Start from develop**: Always create feature branches from the integration branch `develop`.
2. **Feature development**: Work on features/fixes in dedicated feature branches created from `develop`.
3. **Pull Request workflow**: Submit PR from feature branch → `develop` for integration and review.
4. **Code review & CI**: Get 1+ approval AND CI/CD Pipeline must pass on feature PRs to `develop`.
5. **Merge to develop**: After approval and green CI, merge to `develop`.
6. **Release process**: Create a PR from `develop` → `main` to promote integrated changes to production.

**CRITICAL**: Direct pushes to `main` and `develop` are blocked by branch protection; promotions must be done via PRs.

### Branch Protection Management

- **Setup script**: `scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh` - Configure protection rules
- **Status check**: `scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh --status` - View current rules
- **Enforcement**: GitHub API enforced, cannot be bypassed without admin override

## 🚨 CRITICAL FILE ORGANIZATION RULES

### Documentation Structure - NEVER CREATE .MD FILES IN ROOT

- **ALL documentation MUST go in `/docs/` subdirectories** - NEVER create .md files in root directory
- **Community files location**: `/docs/community/` (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Security policy location**: `/.github/SECURITY.md` (for GitHub recognition)
- **Feature documentation**: `/docs/features/` (feature specs, implementation docs)
- **Release notes**: `/docs/releases/` (changelogs, release documentation)
- **Archive old files**: `/docs/archive/` (deprecated or backup files)
- **GitHub templates ONLY**: `.github/` directory (pull_request_template.md, issue templates)

### Root Directory Rules - KEEP CLEAN

- **Only essential files allowed in root**: README.md, LICENSE, package files, configuration files
- **No documentation in root**: Always use `/docs/` subdirectories with proper categorization
- **No feature specs in root**: Use `/docs/features/` directory
- **No community files in root**: Use `/docs/community/` directory

### Validation

- Run `scripts/check-docs-structure.sh` to validate file organization
- Use `--fix` flag to automatically organize misplaced files
- This script should be run before any commits to ensure compliance

## Architecture & Key Components - CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION

### Core Components (IMPLEMENTED)

- **Dockerfile & Docker Images**: Custom GitHub runner Docker images with pre-installed tools (3 variants)
- **Docker Compose Configuration**: Separate compose files for each runner type:
  - `docker-compose.production.yml` - Standard runners with multi-stage build optimization
  - `docker-compose.chrome.yml` - Chrome runners with browser support and Playwright
  - `docker-compose.chrome-go.yml` - Chrome-Go runners with Go toolchain and browser support
- **Configuration Management**: Environment variables and volume mounts for runner configuration
- **Health Checks & Monitoring**: Container health monitoring and automatic restart policies
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Comprehensive testing and deployment automation with BuildKit caching
- **Branch Protection**: Automated branch protection setup via scripts
- **Dependabot Automation**: Auto-merge and auto-rebase workflows for zero-touch dependency updates
- **Performance Optimizations**: BuildKit cache mounts, multi-stage builds, optimized image sizes

>>>>>>> origin/main
```

### Development Workflow - UPDATED

1. **Start from develop**: Always create feature branches from protected `develop` branch.
2. **Work on features**: Implement features and fixes on feature branches.
3. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure changes work and pass all CI/CD tests.
4. **Create PR to develop**: Submit pull request from feature branch → `develop`.
5. **Code review & CI**: Get 1+ approval AND CI/CD Pipeline must pass (required by branch protection).
6. **Merge to develop**: After approval and green CI, merge to `develop`.
7. **Release process**: Create PR from `develop` → `main` for releases (triggers release validation).

**CRITICAL**: Direct pushes to `main` and `develop` are blocked by branch protection rules.

### Post-Merge Back-Sync Workflow

After merging a PR from `develop` to `main` with squash merge:

```bash
# Sync develop with main to prevent "ahead" status
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge main -m "chore: sync develop with main after squash merge"
git push origin develop

# This triggers CI/CD validation on develop branch
# Ensures develop stays in sync with main after squash merges
```

### Dependabot Automation (ZERO-TOUCH UPDATES)

The repository has fully automated dependency management:

**Auto-Merge Workflow** (`.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml`):
- Automatically approves Dependabot PRs
- Enables auto-merge with squash strategy
- Merges after all CI checks pass
- To disable for specific PR: `gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> --disable-auto`

**Auto-Rebase Workflow** (`.github/workflows/dependabot-rebase.yml`):
- Runs hourly to detect out-of-date Dependabot PRs
- Automatically triggers `@dependabot rebase` command
- Keeps multiple PRs current for sequential merging
- Manual trigger: `gh workflow run dependabot-rebase.yml`

**Complete Flow**:
1. Monday 09:00 - Dependabot creates PRs (github-actions, docker)
2. Auto-merge workflow approves and enables auto-merge
3. CI runs (builds, tests, security scans)
4. First PR passes → merges automatically
5. Other PRs become out-of-date
6. Hourly rebase workflow detects and rebases
7. CI re-runs, PRs merge sequentially
8. Zero human intervention required

**Configuration** (`.github/dependabot.yml`):
- Ecosystems: `github-actions`, `docker` (npm managed in Dockerfiles)
- Schedule: Weekly, Monday 09:00
- Target branch: `develop`
- Rebase strategy: `auto`
- Labels: `dependencies`, ecosystem-specific tags

### Common Operations

- **Runner Registration**: Docker entrypoint scripts handle GitHub API token management and single repository runner registration
- **Container Scaling**: Use Docker Compose scaling based on repository job demand
- **Image Updates**: Rebuild and redeploy containers for runner software updates
- **Log Management**: Centralized logging with Docker logging drivers for repository-specific workflows
- **Cache Management**: Local volume-based caching for build artifacts, dependencies, and workspace data

## Project-Specific Conventions

### Technology Stack

This project is built entirely on Docker technology:

- **Docker Engine**: Core containerization platform
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container application orchestration
- **Docker Images**: Custom GitHub runner images with pre-installed tools
- **Docker Volumes**: Persistent storage for configuration and workspace data
- **Docker Networks**: Container communication and isolation

### Runner Type

- **Local Caching**: Persistent volumes for build artifacts, dependencies, and workspace caching
- **Volume-Based Cache**: Docker volumes replace GitHub Actions cache for faster builds
- **Persistent Workspaces**: Shared workspace data across container restarts

### Security Practices

- Store GitHub tokens using Docker secrets or secure environment variable injection
- Use non-root users in Docker containers with minimal required permissions
- Implement container image vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular base image updates and security patches

### Configuration Management

- **Multi-stage Dockerfiles** for different deployment environments
- **Separate compose files** for standard and Chrome runners
- **Health check definitions** in each compose file
- **Local cache volume configuration** for build artifacts and dependencies

### Runner Lifecycle

- Container restart policies for automatic recovery
- Graceful container shutdown with proper signal handling
- Health monitoring with Docker healthcheck commands

## Integration Points

### GitHub API

- Runner registration and management endpoints
- Webhook handling for job notifications
- Repository access control and token management

### Infrastructure Dependencies

- Docker Engine and Docker Compose for container orchestration
- GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) for custom runner image distribution
- Docker-native monitoring tools (Docker stats, cAdvisor, Portainer)

### CI/CD Integration

- Self-testing runner configurations
- Automated deployment pipelines for runner updates
- Integration with existing organizational CI/CD workflows

## Key Files to Understand

- Configuration templates in `config/` directory
- Main setup scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Docker configurations for containerized deployments
- Infrastructure code for automated provisioning

## Development Guidelines

## Development Guidelines

Implement comprehensive logging for troubleshooting runner issues
Use version pinning for runner software to ensure consistency
Document environment-specific setup requirements clearly
Use the dedicated Chrome runner for web UI tests requiring browser automation
- Test runner configurations in isolated environments before production deployment
- Implement comprehensive logging for troubleshooting runner issues
- Use version pinning for runner software to ensure consistency
- Document environment-specific setup requirements clearly
- Use the dedicated Chrome runner for web UI tests requiring browser automation

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- Runner registration failures: Check token permissions and API rate limits
- Job execution failures: Verify runner environment and dependency availability
- Network connectivity: Ensure proper firewall and proxy configurations
- Resource constraints: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage patterns
- Browser testing issues: Use the dedicated Chrome runner for UI test workloads

## Performance Optimization

### BuildKit Cache Optimizations (IMPLEMENTED)

All Dockerfiles leverage BuildKit cache mounts for maximum performance:

**Cache Mount Types**:
- `--mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt` - APT package cache
- `--mount=type=cache,target=/var/lib/apt` - APT lists cache
- `--mount=type=cache,target=/tmp/npm-cache` - npm package cache
- `--mount=type=cache,target=/tmp/downloads` - External downloads (Chrome, Node.js, Go)

**CI/CD Cache Configuration**:
- Cross-branch cache sharing via `buildcache` scope
- Feature branches benefit develop/main cache
- Eliminates full rebuilds on merges
- 50-70% faster builds with cache hits

**Performance Results** (see `docs/PERFORMANCE_RESULTS.md`):
- Standard runner: 19s (96% faster than baseline)
- Chrome runner: 24s (99% faster than baseline)
- Chrome-Go runner: 4m 34s (48% faster than baseline)
- ~985MB bandwidth saved per rebuild
- 100% cache hit rate on unchanged dependencies

**Multi-Stage Build** (Standard Runner Only):
- Builder stage: Downloads and patches runner
- Runtime stage: Only runtime dependencies
- Image size: 2.18GB → 1.81GB (370MB reduction, 17% smaller)
- Better security: Smaller attack surface
- NOT used for Chrome variants (runtime npm required)

### Web UI Testing Performance

- **Dedicated Chrome Runner**: Deployed via `docker-compose.chrome.yml` with Chrome browser optimizations for UI testing
- **Browser Container Isolation**: Chrome runners use separate containers to prevent resource contention with standard runners
- **Headless Browser Configuration**: Pre-configured headless Chrome with optimized flags for CI/CD environments
- **Parallel Test Execution**: Scale Chrome runners horizontally for parallel browser test execution

### Runner Specialization Strategies

- **Standard Runners**: `docker-compose.production.yml` for general building, testing, and deployment tasks
  - Multi-stage build optimized
  - BuildKit cache for fast rebuilds
  - Image size: ~1.8GB
  
- **Chrome Runners**: `docker-compose.chrome.yml` for specialized browser testing
  - Chrome, Selenium, Playwright, Cypress pre-installed
  - BuildKit cache for downloads and npm
  - Playwright chromium browser binaries
  - Image size: ~4.1GB
  
- **Chrome-Go Runners**: `docker-compose.chrome-go.yml` for Go + browser testing
  - All Chrome runner features
  - Go 1.25.4 toolchain
  - BuildKit cache for Go downloads
  - Image size: ~4.5GB
  
- **Mixed Deployment**: Deploy multiple runner types simultaneously for comprehensive CI/CD coverage
- **Cache-Optimized**: All runner types include persistent volume mounts and BuildKit caching
