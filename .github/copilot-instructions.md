# GitHub Runner - AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

This repository is for setting up and managing GitHub Actions self-hosted runners using Docker containers for a single repository. The project focuses on automating containerized runner deployment, configuration, and lifecycle management with Docker and Docker Compose.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL WORKFLOW & BRANCH PROTECTION RULES

### Branch Protection Status - ENFORCED

- **`main` branch**: PROTECTED with branch protection rules
- **`develop` branch**: PROTECTED with branch protection rules
- **Direct pushes BLOCKED**: All changes must go through pull requests
- **Review required**: 1 approving review required before merge
- **Status checks required**: CI/CD Pipeline must pass before merge
- **Force pushes BLOCKED**: History integrity preserved
- **Conversation resolution**: All PR comments must be resolved

### Development Workflow - MANDATORY

1. **Start from develop**: Always create feature branches from the integration branch `develop`.
2. **Feature development**: Work on features/fixes in dedicated feature branches created from `develop`.
3. **Pull Request workflow**: Submit PR from feature branch â†’ `develop` for integration and review.
4. **Code review & CI**: Get 1+ approval AND CI/CD Pipeline must pass on feature PRs to `develop`.
5. **Merge to develop**: After approval and green CI, merge to `develop`.
6. **Release process**: Create a PR from `develop` â†’ `main` to promote integrated changes to production.

**CRITICAL**: Direct pushes to `main` and `develop` are blocked by branch protection; promotions must be done via PRs.

### Branch Protection Management

- **Setup script**: `scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh` - Configure protection rules
- **Status check**: `scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh --status` - View current rules
- **Enforcement**: GitHub API enforced, cannot be bypassed without admin override

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FILE ORGANIZATION RULES

### Documentation Structure - NEVER CREATE .MD FILES IN ROOT

- **ALL documentation MUST go in `/docs/` subdirectories** - NEVER create .md files in root directory
- **Community files location**: `/docs/community/` (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Security policy location**: `/.github/SECURITY.md` (for GitHub recognition)
- **Feature documentation**: `/docs/features/` (feature specs, implementation docs)
- **Release notes**: `/docs/releases/` (changelogs, release documentation)
- **Archive old files**: `/docs/archive/` (deprecated or backup files)
- **GitHub templates ONLY**: `.github/` directory (pull_request_template.md, issue templates)

### Root Directory Rules - KEEP CLEAN

- **Only essential files allowed in root**: README.md, LICENSE, package files, configuration files
- **No documentation in root**: Always use `/docs/` subdirectories with proper categorization
- **No feature specs in root**: Use `/docs/features/` directory
- **No community files in root**: Use `/docs/community/` directory

### Validation

- Run `scripts/check-docs-structure.sh` to validate file organization
- Use `--fix` flag to automatically organize misplaced files
- This script should be run before any commits to ensure compliance

### Development Workflow - UPDATED

1. **Start from develop**: Always create feature branches from protected `develop` branch.
2. **Work on features**: Implement features and fixes on feature branches.
3. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure changes work and pass all CI/CD tests.
4. **Create PR to develop**: Submit pull request from feature branch â†’ `develop`.
5. **Code review & CI**: Get 1+ approval AND CI/CD Pipeline must pass (required by branch protection).
6. **Merge to develop**: After approval and green CI, merge to `develop`.
7. **Release process**: Create PR from `develop` â†’ `main` for releases (triggers release validation).

**CRITICAL**: Direct pushes to `main` and `develop` are blocked by branch protection rules.

### Common Operations

- **Runner Registration**: Docker entrypoint scripts handle GitHub API token management and single repository runner registration
- **Container Scaling**: Use Docker Compose scaling based on repository job demand
- **Image Updates**: Rebuild and redeploy containers for runner software updates
- **Log Management**: Centralized logging with Docker logging drivers for repository-specific workflows
- **Cache Management**: Local volume-based caching for build artifacts, dependencies, and workspace data

## Project-Specific Conventions

### Technology Stack

This project is built entirely on Docker technology:

- **Docker Engine**: Core containerization platform
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container application orchestration
- **Docker Images**: Custom GitHub runner images with pre-installed tools
- **Docker Volumes**: Persistent storage for configuration and workspace data
- **Docker Networks**: Container communication and isolation

### Runner Type

- **Local Caching**: Persistent volumes for build artifacts, dependencies, and workspace caching
- **Volume-Based Cache**: Docker volumes replace GitHub Actions cache for faster builds
- **Persistent Workspaces**: Shared workspace data across container restarts

### Security Practices

- Store GitHub tokens using Docker secrets or secure environment variable injection
- Use non-root users in Docker containers with minimal required permissions
- Implement container image vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular base image updates and security patches

### Configuration Management

- **Multi-stage Dockerfiles** for different deployment environments
- **Separate compose files** for standard and Chrome runners
- **Health check definitions** in each compose file
- **Local cache volume configuration** for build artifacts and dependencies

### Runner Lifecycle

- Container restart policies for automatic recovery
- Graceful container shutdown with proper signal handling
- Health monitoring with Docker healthcheck commands

## Integration Points

### GitHub API

- Runner registration and management endpoints
- Webhook handling for job notifications
- Repository access control and token management

### Infrastructure Dependencies

- Docker Engine and Docker Compose for container orchestration
- GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) for custom runner image distribution
- Docker-native monitoring tools (Docker stats, cAdvisor, Portainer)

### CI/CD Integration

- Self-testing runner configurations
- Automated deployment pipelines for runner updates
- Integration with existing organizational CI/CD workflows

## Key Files to Understand

- Configuration templates in `config/` directory
- Main setup scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Docker configurations for containerized deployments
- Infrastructure code for automated provisioning

## Development Guidelines

## Development Guidelines
 
Test runner configurations in isolated environments before production deployment
Implement comprehensive logging for troubleshooting runner issues
Use version pinning for runner software to ensure consistency
Document environment-specific setup requirements clearly
Use the dedicated Chrome runner for web UI tests requiring browser automation
- Test runner configurations in isolated environments before production deployment
- Implement comprehensive logging for troubleshooting runner issues
- Use version pinning for runner software to ensure consistency
- Document environment-specific setup requirements clearly
- Use the dedicated Chrome runner for web UI tests requiring browser automation

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- Runner registration failures: Check token permissions and API rate limits
- Job execution failures: Verify runner environment and dependency availability
- Network connectivity: Ensure proper firewall and proxy configurations
- Resource constraints: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage patterns
- Browser testing issues: Use the dedicated Chrome runner for UI test workloads

## Performance Optimization

### Web UI Testing Performance

- **Dedicated Chrome Runner**: Deployed via `docker-compose.chrome.yml` with Chrome browser optimizations for UI testing
- **Browser Container Isolation**: Chrome runners use separate containers to prevent resource contention with standard runners
- **Headless Browser Configuration**: Pre-configured headless Chrome with optimized flags for CI/CD environments
- **Parallel Test Execution**: Scale Chrome runners horizontally for parallel browser test execution

### Runner Specialization Strategies

- **Standard Runners**: `docker-compose.production.yml` for general building, testing, and deployment tasks
- **Chrome Runners**: `docker-compose.chrome.yml` for specialized browser testing with Chrome, Selenium, Playwright, Cypress
- **Mixed Deployment**: Deploy both runner types simultaneously for comprehensive CI/CD coverage
- **Cache-Optimized**: Both runner types include persistent volume mounts for dependency caching
