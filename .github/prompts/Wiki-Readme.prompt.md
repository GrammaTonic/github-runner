## ðŸ”§ **Implementation Constraints**

### Technical Constraints

- Must maintain existing README structure and navigation
- Wiki updates must preserve cross-reference links
- All code examples must be tested and functional
- Badge links must point to correct resources

### Content Constraints

- Performance claims must be accurate (60% improvement verified)
- CI/CD status must reflect actual current state (all checks passing)
- Commands must work with current codebase structure
- Links must resolve to existing documentation

### Quality Constraints

- Clear, scannable formatting with proper headings
- Consistent terminology across all documents
- Professional tone appropriate for production documentation
- Comprehensive but not overwhelming information density

## âœ… **Success Criteria**

### Primary Success Metrics

1. **README Visibility**: Chrome Runner prominently featured in main README
2. **Quick Start**: Users can deploy Chrome Runner in under 5 minutes using provided commands
3. **Status Clarity**: Production readiness immediately apparent in all documentation
4. **Problem Resolution**: ChromeDriver issue clearly marked as resolved with solution

### Secondary Success Metrics

1. **Cross-Reference Quality**: Seamless navigation between README and wiki
2. **Example Completeness**: All code examples executable without modification
3. **Status Accuracy**: All status indicators reflect current reality (10/10 CI/CD passing)
4. **Performance Claims**: Metrics properly documented and verifiable

### Validation Tests

1. **README Scan**: Chrome Runner visible within first 3 sections
2. **Wiki Navigation**: All Chrome Runner links functional
3. **Command Execution**: Quick start commands work in clean environment
4. **Status Verification**: CI/CD status matches actual GitHub Actions results

## ðŸ“Š **Current State Context**

### âœ… **Confirmed Working**

- All CI/CD checks passing (10/10 success including Chrome Container Security Scan)
- Chrome Runner Docker image built and available
- ChromeDriver installation issue resolved with Chrome for Testing API
- Security scans completed successfully
- Wiki content manually edited with current information

### ðŸ”„ **Needs Documentation Update**

- README missing Chrome Runner section entirely
- Some wiki status references still show "in progress"

- Quick start commands need visibility boost

### ðŸŽ¯ **Target Outcome**

- Chrome Runner becomes a highlighted feature of the project
- Users immediately understand the performance benefits
- Clear deployment path for production use
- Resolved issues demonstrate project maturity

## ðŸ›  **Recommended Approach**

1. **Start with README**: Add Chrome Runner section for maximum visibility
2. **Update Wiki Status**: Ensure all status indicators show "Production Ready"
3. **Verify Links**: Test all cross-references and external links
4. **Validate Commands**: Ensure all provided examples are executable
5. **Final Review**: Confirm consistency across all documentation

This task represents the final documentation phase of a successful feature implementation, transitioning from development to production readiness communication.
