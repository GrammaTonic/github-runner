# Feature: Automated Staging Runner Deployment

## Overview

Automatically deploy and register a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner in the staging environment as part of the CI/CD pipeline. This enables jobs requiring `self-hosted` runners to run in staging without manual intervention.

## Motivation

- Eliminate manual runner setup for staging tests
- Ensure all pipeline jobs can run in staging
- Improve reliability and automation of CI/CD workflows

## Requirements

- Provision a runner container in staging using Docker Compose or direct Docker commands
- Register the runner with the repository using a GitHub token
- Label the runner for staging
- Ensure runner is available for subsequent jobs
- Optional: Add teardown/cleanup logic to remove the runner after tests

## Implementation Plan

1. Add a new workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy-staging-runner.yml`
2. Use a GitHub Actions job to provision a runner container in staging
3. Register the runner with the repository
4. Label the runner for staging
5. Add teardown/cleanup logic (optional)

## Success Criteria

- Staging runner is deployed and registered automatically
- Jobs requiring `self-hosted` runners run successfully in staging
- No manual runner setup required for staging tests
