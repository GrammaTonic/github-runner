# Security Advisory Management Workflow

This document explains the new security management approach that replaces the previous issue-creating workflow.

## üéØ Overview

The Security Advisory Management workflow provides comprehensive vulnerability scanning without cluttering the GitHub Issues view. Instead, it leverages GitHub's built-in security features for better organization and tracking.

## üîÑ Migration from Security Issues Workflow

### What Changed

**‚ùå Old Approach (security-issues.yml - DISABLED)**

- Created individual GitHub issues for each vulnerability
- Polluted the issues view with automated content
- Mixed security findings with regular project issues
- Required manual cleanup of security-related issues

**‚úÖ New Approach (security-advisories.yml)**

- Uses GitHub Security tab for vulnerability tracking
- Generates comprehensive summary reports as artifacts
- Maintains clean separation between security and project issues
- Provides better visualization and remediation tracking

### Migration Benefits

1. **Clean Issues View**: No more automated security issues cluttering your project issues
2. **Centralized Security**: All vulnerabilities visible in GitHub Security tab
3. **Better Organization**: SARIF format enables rich security insights
4. **Artifact Storage**: Detailed reports stored as downloadable artifacts
5. **Integration Ready**: Compatible with GitHub's security ecosystem

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Features

### Automated Scanning

- **Schedule**: Weekly on Monday at 2 AM UTC
- **Manual Trigger**: Workflow dispatch with configurable options
- **Multi-Target**: Filesystem, container, and Chrome runner scanning
- **Severity Filtering**: Configurable minimum severity levels

### Scan Targets

1. **Filesystem Scan**

   - Dependencies and packages in the repository
   - Configuration files and scripts
   - Source code vulnerabilities

2. **Container Scan (Standard Runner)**

   - Base image vulnerabilities
   - Installed packages and tools
   - Runtime environment security

3. **Container Scan (Chrome Runner)**
   - Chrome-specific dependencies
   - Browser automation tools
   - Extended security surface

### Security Integration

- **SARIF Upload**: Results automatically uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- **Advisory Creation**: Enables creation of security advisories for findings
- **Dependabot Integration**: Works alongside Dependabot alerts
- **Code Scanning**: Integrates with GitHub's code scanning features

## üìä Report Generation

### Summary Reports

The workflow generates comprehensive summary reports including:

- **Vulnerability Counts**: By severity and scan target
- **Priority Actions**: Immediate attention items highlighted
- **Resource Links**: Direct links to GitHub security features
- **Remediation Guidance**: Step-by-step fix recommendations

### Artifact Storage

- **Security Scan Reports**: Detailed JSON and SARIF files
- **Summary Documents**: Human-readable security summaries
- **Retention Policy**: 90-day retention for compliance and tracking
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old artifacts cleaned up after 30 days

## üîß Configuration Options

### Workflow Dispatch Parameters

```yaml
severity_filter:
  description: "Minimum severity level"
  options: ["CRITICAL", "HIGH", "MEDIUM", "LOW"]
  default: "HIGH"

scan_targets:
  description: "Scan targets (comma-separated)"
  default: "filesystem,container,chrome"
```

### Customization

To customize the workflow for your needs:

1. **Modify Severity Levels**: Change default minimum severity
2. **Adjust Scan Targets**: Enable/disable specific scan types
3. **Update Schedule**: Modify cron expression for scan frequency
4. **Extend Retention**: Adjust artifact retention periods

## üìã Using the Security Tab

### Accessing Security Findings

1. Navigate to your repository's **Security** tab
2. Click **Code scanning** to view vulnerability findings
3. Filter by **Category** to see different scan types:
   - `filesystem-scan`: Repository dependencies and files
   - `container-scan`: Standard runner container
   - `chrome-container-scan`: Chrome runner container

### Managing Vulnerabilities

1. **Review Findings**: Click on any vulnerability for detailed information
2. **Create Advisories**: Use GitHub's advisory system for coordination
3. **Track Remediation**: Mark vulnerabilities as resolved after fixes
4. **Monitor Trends**: Use the overview to track security improvements

## üöÄ Getting Started

### First Run

1. **Manual Trigger**: Go to Actions ‚Üí Security Advisory Management ‚Üí Run workflow
2. **Configure Settings**: Choose severity level and scan targets
3. **Review Results**: Check the Security tab after completion
4. **Download Reports**: Access detailed artifacts if needed

### Regular Monitoring

1. **Weekly Scans**: Automatic scans run every Monday
2. **Artifact Review**: Download and review weekly reports
3. **Priority Actions**: Address critical and high severity findings
4. **Trend Analysis**: Monitor security posture improvements over time

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy Integration

This workflow integrates with your repository's security policy:

1. **Vulnerability Disclosure**: Use GitHub Advisories for coordinated disclosure
2. **Response Timeline**: Automated scanning supports timely vulnerability response
3. **Compliance Tracking**: Artifact retention supports audit requirements
4. **Community Safety**: Clean separation keeps security findings organized
