# Security Vulnerability Management Project

This document outlines the comprehensive security vulnerability management system for the GitHub Runner project using Trivy scanner integration.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Objective**: Systematically track, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities found by Trivy scanner in Docker images, dependencies, and infrastructure code.

**Scope**: All security vulnerabilities identified by Trivy scans across:

- Filesystem (source code, dependencies)
- Standard Runner Docker containers
- Chrome Runner Docker containers
- Base images and dependencies

## 🏗️ Project Structure

### GitHub Project Components

1. **Project Board**: "Security Vulnerability Management"
2. **Issue Labels**:

   - `security` - All security-related issues
   - `vulnerability` - Confirmed vulnerabilities
   - `trivy` - Issues created from Trivy scans
   - `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` - Severity levels
   - `needs-triage` - Requires initial assessment
   - `false-positive` - Confirmed false positives
   - `wont-fix` - Accepted risk, will not fix

3. **Project Views**:
   - **Triage View**: New vulnerabilities needing assessment
   - **Priority View**: Sorted by severity and impact
   - **Progress View**: Track remediation progress
   - **Component View**: Group by affected component

## 🔄 Workflow Process

### 1. Automated Discovery

- **Trivy Scans**: Run automatically on:

  - Every push to main branch
  - Weekly scheduled scans
  - Before releases
  - Manual triggers

- **Issue Creation**: Automated script creates GitHub issues for:
  - New vulnerabilities (not previously reported)
  - Severity >= MEDIUM (configurable)
  - Includes CVE details, affected packages, remediation steps

### 2. Triage Process

**Initial Triage** (Within 24 hours):

- [ ] Verify vulnerability is legitimate (not false positive)
- [ ] Assess actual impact on our use case
- [ ] Determine if vulnerability is exploitable in our context
- [ ] Set priority level (P0-P3)
- [ ] Assign to appropriate team member

**Triage Criteria**:

- **P0 (Critical)**: Exploitable remotely, affects production, high impact
- **P1 (High)**: Exploitable with authentication, moderate impact
- **P2 (Medium)**: Local exploitation, low impact, or mitigations available
- **P3 (Low)**: Theoretical risk, minimal impact, or not applicable

### 3. Remediation Planning

**Assessment**:

- [ ] Identify affected components
- [ ] Check for available patches/updates
- [ ] Evaluate alternative solutions
- [ ] Assess deployment impact
- [ ] Plan testing strategy

**Documentation**:

- [ ] Document remediation approach
- [ ] Estimate effort and timeline
- [ ] Identify dependencies and blockers
- [ ] Plan rollback strategy if needed

### 4. Implementation

**Development**:

- [ ] Update affected packages/images
- [ ] Test changes in development environment
- [ ] Verify vulnerability is resolved
- [ ] Ensure no regression issues
- [ ] Update documentation

**Deployment**:

- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run security scans to confirm fix
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor for issues

### 5. Verification & Closure

**Verification**:

- [ ] Confirm vulnerability no longer appears in scans
- [ ] Verify system functionality intact
- [ ] Check for any new issues introduced
- [ ] Update security documentation

**Closure**:

- [ ] Document final resolution
- [ ] Update knowledge base
- [ ] Close GitHub issue
- [ ] Archive related artifacts

## 📊 Project Tracking

### Key Metrics

1. **Discovery Metrics**:

   - Total vulnerabilities found
   - New vulnerabilities per week
   - Severity distribution
   - Component breakdown

2. **Response Metrics**:

   - Time to triage (target: < 24 hours)
   - Time to fix by severity:
     - Critical: < 24 hours
     - High: < 1 week
     - Medium: < 1 month
     - Low: Best effort

3. **Quality Metrics**:
   - False positive rate
   - Reopen rate
   - Coverage (% of components scanned)

### Reporting

**Weekly Security Report**:

- New vulnerabilities discovered
- Vulnerabilities fixed
- High-priority items in progress
- Overdue items requiring attention

**Monthly Security Review**:

- Trend analysis
- Process improvements
- Tool effectiveness
- Risk assessment updates

## 🛠️ Tools & Automation

### Trivy Integration

```bash
# Manual scan command
./scripts/create-security-issues.sh

# Dry run to preview
DRY_RUN=true ./scripts/create-security-issues.sh

# High severity only
MIN_SEVERITY=HIGH ./scripts/create-security-issues.sh
```

### GitHub Actions Automation

- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/security-issues.yml`
- **Schedule**: Weekly automated scans
- **Manual Trigger**: On-demand scans with custom parameters
- **Integration**: Automatic issue creation and project updates

### Issue Templates

- **Security Vulnerability Template**: Structured reporting
- **Required Fields**: Severity, CVE ID, affected package, remediation
- **Automated Labeling**: Consistent categorization

## 📋 Standard Operating Procedures

### New Vulnerability Response

**Critical/High Severity (24 hours)**:

1. Immediate notification to security team
2. Emergency assessment within 2 hours
3. Hotfix deployment if required
4. Post-incident review

**Medium Severity (1 week)**:

1. Include in next sprint planning
2. Regular development process
3. Testing in next release cycle

**Low Severity (Best effort)**:

1. Technical debt backlog
2. Address during maintenance windows
3. Consider in major version updates

### False Positive Handling

1. **Verification**: Confirm it's actually a false positive
2. **Documentation**: Document why it's not applicable
3. **Suppression**: Add to Trivy ignore list if appropriate
4. **Labeling**: Mark with `false-positive` label
5. **Closure**: Close issue with explanation

### Release Security Checklist

Before each release:

- [ ] Run complete Trivy security scan
- [ ] Verify no critical/high vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document known medium/low issues
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Generate security report for release notes

## 🔗 Integration Points

### GitHub Project Setup

1. Create new GitHub Project: "Security Vulnerability Management"
2. Add custom fields:
   - CVE ID
   - Severity
   - Priority
   - Component
   - Discovery Date
   - Target Fix Date
3. Set up automation rules for issue categorization

### External Tools

- **Trivy**: Primary vulnerability scanner
- **GitHub Security**: Security advisories and alerts
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **NIST NVD**: CVE database for additional context
