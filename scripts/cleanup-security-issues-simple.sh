CLOSE_MESSAGE="ðŸ”„ **Security Workflow Migration**

This automated security issue is being closed as part of our migration to GitHub's native Security Advisory workflow.

**New Security Management**:
- Security findings are now in the **Security** tab
- Vulnerability reports are generated as workflow artifacts  
- Clean project management without issue spam

**Find security information**:
- **Security** â†’ **Code scanning** for current findings
- Weekly security workflow artifacts for detailed reports

Thanks for your understanding as we improve our security process!"
