CLOSE_MESSAGE="ðŸ”„ **Security Workflow Migration**

This automated security issue is being closed as part of our migration to GitHub's native Security Advisory workflow.

**New Security Management**:
- Security findings are now available in the **Security** tab
- Comprehensive vulnerability reports are generated as workflow artifacts
- No more issue spam - clean project management

**Where to find security information**:
- Navigate to **Security** â†’ **Code scanning** for current findings
- Check weekly security workflow artifacts for detailed reports
- Security advisories are managed through GitHub's Security tab

Thank you for your understanding as we improve our security management process!"
